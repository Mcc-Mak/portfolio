1. Login to `VitalSource` as `martinmcc5804@gmail.com`
2. Scrape from web: https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/reader/books/9781394255085?library_return_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshelf.vitalsource.com%2Fhome%2Fdashboard
- `Questions`
```
const text = Object.keys([...new Array(100)])
	.map(e=>parseInt(e)+1)
	.map(i=>{
		let q;
		if(i<10) q = `00${i}`;
		else if(i<100) q = `0${i}`;
		else q = `${i}`;
		const s = `#c01-ex-0${q}`;
		const e = document.querySelector(s);
		return `====\nQuestion ${q}:\n${e.innerHTML}`;
	})
	.join('\n');
console.log(text);
```
- `Answers`
```
const text = Object.keys([...new Array(100)])
	.map(e=>parseInt(e)+1)
	.map(i=>{
		let q;
		if(i<10) q = `00${i}`;
		else if(i<100) q = `0${i}`;
		else q = `${i}`;
		const s = `#bapp01-ex-0${q}`;
		return `====\Answer ${q}:\n${document.querySelector(s).innerText}`;
	})
	.join('\n\n');
console.log(text);
```
3. Create `mcq_platform` as `mcq_domain_1.html`
```
Create a `mcq_domain_1.html` to provide a `mcq_platform` for `Domain 1`.
- Question Types: `Many choose one` (radio), `Many choose one or many` (checkbox), `Mapping` (e.g. A-4;B-2;C-1;D-3)
- Score after submission
- Show summary report for the results, and also allow to export as CSV
```
## Fulfillment of CISSP working experiences
1. About `what I built`
- 🔴 `Year 1` to `Year3`
  - Develop a **web application** served as a _booking appointment system_ by **C# .NET**
  - Develop a **window form** served as a _query system_ in **C#**
  - Develop a **window form** served as a _socket server_ in **Java**
  - Code for a **web application** served as a _workflow system_ in **Java** (in **Springboot**) collaboratively
- 🔴 `Year 4` to `Year 6`
  - Develop a **web application** served as a _earthquake information dissemination application_ in **HTML**/**JS**/**CSS** (in **LAMP**), including input validation for earthquake data entry
  - Develop a **web application** served as a _locally felt information application_ via **JS** (in **MERN**), including assuring secure API in internal network protected by organization firewall
  - Fulfill **adhoc tasks** for _normal operations of the other systems_
2. About `how I secured it`
- 🔴 `Year 1` to `Year 3`
  - **Secure Software Lifecycle Management:** Managed the security of a **.NET** booking system and **Java-based** workflow application by implementing **_parameterized queries_** to protect against SQL injection and common web vulnerabilities (`Domain 8`).
- 🔴 `Year 4` to `Year 6`
  - **Application Security Testing & Validation:** Led the development earthquake information system for internal use, implementing rigorous **_client-side input validation_** and **_input encoding_** to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection risks (`Domain 8`).
  - **Network and API Security:** Architected and **_secured internal APIs_** within a **MERN** stack environment, ensuring secure communication through firewall policy alignment, network segmentation, and endpoint protection within the organizational perimeter (`Domain 4`).
  - **Security Operations & Maintenance:** Performed **_continuous security monitoring_** and ad-hoc **_vulnerability remediation_** for legacy systems to ensure ongoing availability and resilience of critical information dissemination services (`Domain 7`).

## Coding Standards

The MCQ platform (`mcq_platform/`) consists of 12 self-contained HTML files (8 domain tests + 4 practice tests) with inline CSS and JavaScript. Exam result logs are stored as CSV in `log/`.

### File Naming

- Directories and files use `snake_case` ASCII (`[a-z0-9_.]` charset)
- HTML files: `mcq_domain_N.html` (domain tests), `mcq_practice_test_N.html` (practice tests)
- CSV logs: `domainN.csv`, `domainN_trialM.csv`, `practice_exam_N.csv`, `results_{type}.csv`

### HTML

- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`)
- Inline CSS within a single `<style>` block in `<head>`
- Inline JavaScript within a single `<script>` block before `</body>`

### CSS

- Class names use `kebab-case` (e.g., `btn-export`, `score-area`, `result-table`)
- Mobile-first responsive design with flexbox layouts

### JavaScript

- `const`/`let` only — no `var`
- Arrow functions for callbacks
- Template literals for string interpolation
- `camelCase` for variables and function names
- Question data stored as arrays of objects with consistent schema (`qid`, `question`, `options`, `answer`, `explanation`)
- CSV export via `Blob` + `URL.createObjectURL`
